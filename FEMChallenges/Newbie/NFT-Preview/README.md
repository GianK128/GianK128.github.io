## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
  - Positioning
  - Flexbox

### What I learned

I tried to use this challenge to practice on my HTML DOM structure and element hierarchy, trying to reduce the use of `<div>` elements.
Also, I was trying to solidify my usage of CSS properties and flexbox.

### Continued development

I think I still have to work on element hierarchy and different techniques to display content with CSS.

Also, I have to relearn some properties which I think could've been useful in this challenge, but haven't been used.

### Useful resources

- [Website structure - MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure) - This is the page where I started learning structuring and hierarchy from.
